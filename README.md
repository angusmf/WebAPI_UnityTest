Example code cobbled together from Google Signin examples for getting a openid Connect token id from Google.
This is used to log into the authorization web app (https://github.com/angusmf/WebAPI)
Uses client code generated at SwaggerHub from an OpenAPI 3.0 spec.
The OpenAPI doc is partially generated by Swashbuckle as part of the Web app, though it had to be manually converted from 2.0 to add return values.
